# HN New Tabber

I honestly just made this so that I can open [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) discussion links in the [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/) peek window from my pinned tab, but it should work to open any HackerNews discussion in a new tab on any Chromium-based browser.

It costs $5 to register my account on the Chrome Web Store to share it, so I'm just not bothering :)

To install just go to the extension management/settings page and drag-and-drop the `.crx` file downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/ZeinHajjAli/HN-New-Tabber/releases) page. You might have to review and keep the extension since it isn't coming from the Chrome Web Store.

Otherwise, you can clone the repo, enable developer mode in the extensions settings page, and use the `load unpacked` button to load the extension from the repo folder.
